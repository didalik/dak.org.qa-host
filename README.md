# Get paid for hosting our QA!

Hi there, I'm Дід Alik. I have a hobby project called [Stellar Help Exchange](https://github.com/amissine/shex/blob/main/README.md#presentation "Stellar HEX, work in progress"). As of October 21, 2024, it passes all the integration tests locally. In these tests, I simulate Stellar HEX users to interact with the project's website via [Stellar](https://stellar.org/) testnet.
