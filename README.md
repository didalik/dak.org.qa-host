# Get paid for hosting our QA!

Hi there, I'm Дід Alik. I have a hobby project called [Stellar Help Exchange](https://github.com/amissine/shex/blob/main/README.md#presentation "Stellar HEX, work in progress"). As of October 21, 2024, it passes all the integration tests locally. In these tests, the project's website interacts with Stellar HEX users - simulated locally - via [Stellar](https://stellar.org/) testnet.

Before I move the website to production and connect it to Stellar public network, I want to setup a cloud-based QA environment to simulate Stellar HEX users globally. And I shall pay you **HEXA 1000** for hosting a QA hub for us on your [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) box. It doesn't have to be up 24/7, but when it is, I shall pay you **HEXA 100** each time a tester uses your box to interact with the project's website.
